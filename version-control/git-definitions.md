# Git Definitions

Hi Glenna!

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version Control tracks changes in a code without altering the master/original code. It is useful because if there are any bugs or issues it can be easily looked at with the dates and each update instead of combing through the whole code. 
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is like a copy of the original in which you make changes to and reapply to the master if the changes work and are completed. You would use one to avoid making changes to the original code that you may not know would work. It also makes it easier to work with multiple people on different features without stepping on each other's toes. 
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
* A commit is when you make a save to go back to just in case the new code you add makes you lose your original work you were just working on. A good commit message is detailed on the changes done.
* What is a merge conflict?
* A merge conflict is when you are trying to integrate your branch and other branches in to the master code and combine them all into one code file.
