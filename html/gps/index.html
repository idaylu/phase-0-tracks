<--What is the purpose of HTML5 semantic tags? Which ones do you see as most useful?
The purpose of semantic tags is to show the separation of content within the page and shows what is within the tags. The ones I see as most useful would be section, header, and nav. Section separates the content of the page. The header provides information either introducing the page or navigating the page. The nav is used to navigate the page or between pages. They are all useful to separate the page out meaningfully.
What is the order the browser uses to display elements on a page?
The browser displays the elements based off of the the order. IT reads top down but also with elements that structure the page such as header, footer,title; these will appear in the location that the tag represents.
What did you learn about Sublime in this challenge? Do you think you'll create more handy snippets at a later date?
I learned that sublime is quite customizable to the user to make their coding experience more efficient with the snippets. I most definitely will be creating more snippets to make the process of coding more efficient.
What concept in this challenge was most difficult for you? How can you improve your understanding of this concept?
I think the most challenging is separating out when to use the semantics. Some of them are more self explanatory than others. What helped with improving my understanding of the concept was to individually look up each element and to see it used in an example. I learn best with examples and a visual and that helped with distinguishing the elements and their proper placement in the html code.
